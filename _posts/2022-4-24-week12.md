<h2>Project Reports </h2>

<p> This week there were presentations about each groups projects. They were intended to be like standups but ended up being more of a formal presentation. It seemed like most people were making solid progress and I am alos personally satisfied with how
my group did. I feel we got across the difficulties we have faced while also focusing properly on the positives we did complete. It was particularly interesting to hear what other groups working on oppia had to say, as they ran into different issues than us.
I was surpsied to find that they had a bit better luck with some of the typescript type annotation issues. That was the only real overlap between our gruops though as it seems we've all focused on different issues(they were much more front end oriented then our team). 
Despite some setbacks our team has made good progress! We all either have or are about to complete our second issues. I am personally really happy as i found a different issue to work on, which doesnt seem to have as many issues. It is basically done and all I need to do is fix up my git(it's throwing a 403 on push for some reason) and I should have a PR done.
I have high hopes for finishing strong.</p>
